# UltraKiosk

This is a very simple iOS application designed to run HomeAssistant in a fullscreen kiosk mode. It also includes functionality to use your iOS device as a voice satellite, so it is best suited to run an iPad as an intelligent wall-mounted display.

Core-Features are:
* Run HomeAssistant dashboards in fullscreen Kiosk mode (works best with HACS Kioskmode)
* Activate a screensaver saver after some time of inactivity
* Resume display using the device camera with face detection
* Act as a voice satellite with HomeAssistant Voice Pipeline in always-active mode

Planned:
* MQTT integration and device discovery
